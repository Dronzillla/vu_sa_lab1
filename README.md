# Laboratory assignment 1

## Laboratory assignment 1.A Requirements
- Create MVC, MVU or MVVM architectural pattern driven web site
- Site should allow creating, editing, viewing and deleting of at least one entity that is the main focus of business aplication (no persistence required)
- Business entity should contain at least 4 editable properties
- Implement validation for all editable properties in create and update scenarios
- Demonstrate usage of DI+IOC

## Laboratory assignment 1.B Requirements
- Create Web service as API
- Demonstrate 1 business entity creation, reading, editing, deleting, use 4 HTTP verbs (no persistence required)
- Business entity should contain at least 4 editable properties
- Unit tests for all API public contracts (100% coverage)

## Laboratory assignment 1.C Requirements
- Implement DB layer by using ORM or plain SQL with Repository pattern
- Demonstrate 1 business entity creation, reading, editing, deleting
- Business entity should contain at least 4 editable properties
- Integrate 1.A, 1.B and 1.C alltogether (website uses API to manipulate data, where API uses DB layer to manipulate data in database)

## Solution
- I developed a web application using the MVC architectural pattern and the Flask web framework.
- The application supports creating, editing, viewing, and deleting tasks.
- Four task properties can be modified: title, description, due date, and completion status.
- Data validation rules include: the title and due date cannot be blank, the title must contain non-numeric characters, and the due date cannot be in the past.
- The database layer is implemented using SQLAlchemy ORM.
- The application leverages an API to perform CRUD operations, with API routes also used on the front end.
- The front end is built using the Jinja2 templating engine, without any additional front-end libraries.
- Unit tests for all API routes were implemented using pytest, achieving 100% test coverage.
